Dine & Divide is the perfect solution for those moments when you're out with a friend and want to split the bill seamlessly. Whether it's a cozy dinner or a lively lunch, our app simplifies the process of sharing expenses with your dining partner.

Key Features:

Share a Meal: Start by entering the total bill amount. Let's say it's €100 or $100.

Allocate Expenses: Specify your individual expenses within the group bill. For instance, if your part of the meal cost €40, you simply input €40 as your contribution.

Select Your Companion: Choose the friend you're dining with, like Anthony, and allocate their expenses accordingly. In this case, Anthony's share would be €60.

Settle the Bill: Now comes the fun part. Determine who will foot the bill. It could be you or Anthony. Your choice.

Balance Tracking: As the bill payer, the app instantly calculates the owed amount. In this scenario, if you're paying, Anthony owes you €60. If Anthony covers the bill, you owe him €40.
